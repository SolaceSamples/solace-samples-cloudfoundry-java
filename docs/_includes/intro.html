        <p>These tutorials walk through Java Sample applications which aim to introduce you to Solace Messaging for Pivotal Cloud Foundry. The goal of these sample applications is to illustrate various ways of consuming the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable from a Solace Messaging Cloud Foundry service instance. What follows is a brief introduction to Solace Messaging in Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) and links for easy wasy to learn more. If you're familiar with Pivotal Cloud Foundry, jump straight to the Getting Started tutorials.</p>

        <p>Solace Messaging for Pivotal Cloud Foundry provides high-performance, robust, enterprise-grade messaging technology over a wide variety of open protocols (including JMS, MQTT, REST, WebSocket), qualities of service (best-effort, guaranteed, transactions) and messaging patterns (publish/subscribe, request/reply, streaming, fanin/fanout).</p>

        <p>Solace Messaging is available in a number of network and deployment environments including Public/Private PaaS, Public/Private IaaS, LAN, WAN, Web, and Wireless ensuring your applications will have Solace Messaging available to them wherever they are deployed.</p>

        <p>Solace Messaging supports High Availability configurations, where each message router is assigned a backup that takes over in case of failures. Details about how to use this are in the Java Application tutorial.

        <p>We provide support for MQTT. Devices and applications running outside of Cloud Foundry can connect with
        Solace Messaging services running in Cloud Foundry, by using the TCP Routes feature. This features provides
        endpoints that allow external connections. Please read the <a href="http://dev.solace.com/get-started/mqtt-tutorials/publish-subscribe_mqtt/" target="_top">Solace MQTT Tuturial</a>.The Solace Messaging Cloud Foundry tile documentation describes the TCP Routes feature.
